## What is this?

Most chess tools give you engine analysis — cold numbers and arrows. **ChessCoach AI** does something different:

- Connects to your **Chess.com game history** via the public API
- Analyzes **patterns across hundreds of your games**
- Finds your **specific weaknesses** (not generic advice)
- Answers questions like *"Why do I keep losing as Black?"* with data-backed, personalized explanations
- Generates a **personalized weekly study plan** based on your actual weak spots

## The RAG Pipeline

```
Chess.com API
      ↓
fetch_games.py     →  pulls your game history as PGN files
      ↓
parse_pgn.py       →  extracts structured data (opening, result, accuracy, moves)
      ↓
chunker.py         →  splits each game into Opening / Middlegame / Endgame segments
      ↓
embedder.py        →  converts chunks to vectors using fastembed
      ↓
Qdrant             →  stores and indexes all vectors locally
      ↓
retriever.py       →  finds relevant game moments for any question
      ↓
Groq LLM           →  generates personalized, specific answers
      ↓
FastAPI + Next.js  →  clean chat UI
```

## Example Questions You Can Ask

Once fully built, you'll be able to ask:

- *"Why do I keep losing as Black?"*
- *"What's my worst opening and why?"*
- *"Do I blunder more in endgames or middlegames?"*
- *"Give me a study plan for this week based on my weaknesses"*
- *"How does my accuracy change when I'm low on time?"*

## What makes this different from just using ChatGPT?

ChatGPT has no access to your game history. It can only give generic chess advice.

ChessCoach AI has **your 276 games embedded in a vector database**. Every answer is grounded in your specific patterns — not generic theory.

| | Generic AI | ChessCoach AI |
|---|---|---|
| Knows your game history | ❌ | ✅ |
| Pattern detection across 500+ games | ❌ | ✅ |
| Personalized study plan | ❌ | ✅ |
| Works without uploading files manually | ❌ | ✅ |

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `CHESSCOM_USERNAME` | Your Chess.com username |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | Free API key from console.groq.com |
