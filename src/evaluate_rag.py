QUESTION: {question}
REFERENCE (what a good answer should cover): {reference}
RETRIEVED CONTEXT (what was given to the AI): {context[:800]}
ACTUAL ANSWER: {answer}

Score these metrics:
1. faithfulness: Is the answer based on the retrieved context? (1.0 = fully grounded, 0.0 = hallucinated)
2. answer_relevancy: Does the answer address the question asked? (1.0 = perfectly relevant, 0.0 = off topic)
3. context_precision: Did the context contain what was needed to answer? (1.0 = perfect context, 0.0 = wrong context)
